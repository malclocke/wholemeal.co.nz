Jan 17th - 24th 2010 is going to be a busy week, as I'll be attending both the <a href="http://www.lca2010.org.nz/">linux.conf.au</a> and <a href="http://wellington2010.drupalsouth.net.nz/">Drupal South</a> conferences back to back.
<!--break-->
It looks set to be a great week to showcase Free and Open Source Software in the capital, with some of the big hitters from the Linux and Drupal communities in attendance.

If you'd like to meet up for a chat, please <a href="/contact">contact me</a> and let me know.
