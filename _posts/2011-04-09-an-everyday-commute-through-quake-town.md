To help give people outside of Christchurch an understanding of how widespread
the effect of the Feb 22nd earthquake has been on Christchurch, I thought I'd
take some photo's of everything quake related that I see on my cycle commute
from the eastern suburbs into town.

It's now nearly 6 weeks on from the quake, but the images below will hopefully
show how far we still have to go.

These are by no means the worst of the devastation, but they represent what the
typical Christchurch resident will see on an average trip into town.  I didn't
deviate from my normal route to take any of these shots.

First up is our local chippy, about 100 metres from home.  Thankfully, all the
staff made it out unscathed.

This is a cell phone tower on wheels.  There's a generator inside, and some
kind of wireless uplink to the main network.

The reason this temporary tower is in place, taken a few weeks before the rest
of these photos.

In many places along the Avon river, the river banks have slumped or collapsed,
in some cases several feet.  With winter weather approaching, there seems to
be a concerted effort to build up the banks to prevent flooding.  This is
the view west along the river from Wainoni bridge.

Whilst most of the city has regained a water supply, some still haven't.  On
top of this, many peoples hot water systems require full mains pressure to work
correctly, and full water pressure has not returned to a lot of places.

So there are several of these mobile showers available for residents around the
city.  This one is outside the Avonside Golf Course.

Drinking water for residents is available from large tanks in key locations.
These seem to be getting very little use now as mains water returns to more
and more homes.

The worst hit areas are designated 'residents only', because heavy traffic
can cause further damage to already fragile houses.  This notice is still
in place from the September 2010 quake.

The beaches and rivers are still no-go areas for recreation, and here's why.
The city's sewerage system is severely damaged.  The pipe at the bottom of the
shot is pumping raw you-know-what into the river, and is one of many sites
along the river and on the beaches where this is happening.

The foot bridge in the background is also closed, as it contains a 66,000 vault
electricity cable, status unknown.

Post demolition, this is what remains of the average single story house.
Most of the houses that were badly damaged enough to warrant an immediate 
demolition like this would have borne a 'red sticker', an 'absolutely no
entry' notice.  If that was the case, the house would have been demolished
with all of it's contents still inside.

More shoring of the river banks.  The river is still tidal at this point, and
at high tide the water level is already close to bursting on an average day.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/malclocke/5602832576/" title="IMG_5560 by malclocke, on Flickr"><img class="flickr" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4095/5602832576_c47bf87b4e.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_5560"></a>

Some areas are still without mains power.  Large generators like this one are
keeping the lights on for those neighbourhoods.  Our own street was on one of
these for the first two weeks after the quake.

An ad hock community notice board has also popped up here.

I hadn't even noticed this house, behind a high fence, until the day I took
these photos and I was being more observant than usual.  This place used to be
two story, the lower floor has completely collapsed.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/malclocke/5602242159/" title="IMG_5562 by malclocke, on Flickr"><img class="flickr" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5266/5602242159_7f9949b443.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="IMG_5562"></a> 

This place was a once grand 2 story residence that was fairly rough around
the edges before the quake.  It's days are numbered now, a large digger is
parked just out of shot ready to begin the demolition.

Demolition in progress.  I happened to ride past these shops on the corner of
Stanmore Road and Worcester Street at the moment they were pulling the roof
off.  Thankfully, as with a lot of the cities collapsed buildings, this row
of shops were already off limits before the February quake due to damage
sustained in September.

The edge of the city cordon.  A very large area of the central city is still
off limits to the public.  Each entry point is manned by police and army
personnel.  This is the checkpoint on St Asaph and Barbadoes Streets.

One of the stranger factors of all the damage is exposure of the inside of
peoples homes to the public gaze.  Here's someone's previously private bathroom
and toilet.

A collapsed warehouse.  I'm unsure what this place was.

Christchurch's biggest headache, the Hotel Grand Chancellor.  At 26 stories,
it's the cities second tallest building.  As is blatantly obvious from this
photo, it's not well.

A few days after the quake, the collapsed corner of the hotel was temporarily
supported with new concrete struts to allow Urban Search and Rescue to enter
the building.

The hotel lies in the heart of the city, and until it is demolished it's
likely at least two blocks either side of it will remain off limits for
everyone.  How the building is to be demolished safely is still, as far as
I'm aware, unknown.
