We've been working away for a while on a new <a
href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> project, and have decided to
release it under the <acronym title="GNU Public License">GPL</acronym>.  Check
it out on <a href="http://github.com/malclocke/dogsheet">GitHub</a>.

The project will scratch an itch we have for tracking time against stories in
<a href="http://pivotaltracker.com">Pivotal Tracker</a>, a project management
application for agile development.  It's still in it's infancy at the moment,
but development is moving along at the pace you would expect from a Rails app,
keep an eye on the project if you're looking for the worlds greatest time
tracker!
